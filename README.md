MoboReader
==========

getPocket.com (formerly read it later) client for webOS and LuneOS. Works in Browser, too. May be portable to Firefox OS or other systems.
Includes spritz support (needs node.js service or active internet connection).

A node.js service for webOS and LuneOS is included. It allows complete download of articles and images for offline use. Also it allows offline download of the spritz-client. So a complete offline use of the app is possible. In fact that was one of the design goals.
